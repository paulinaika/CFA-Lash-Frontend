# CFA Project 3

# About

This project is designed for Fave-Lashes in order to manage their inventory stock count.

## Problems
The problems faced by the client are as follows:
1. Hard to track inventory
2. Manual calculation for stock counts
3. No proper customer database
4. Current inventory tracking system and database is in excel document
5. Difficulty in managing Profit and Loss statement

## Project Focus
Due to the time limitation of this project, I have chosen to focus on the first two problems and created an API back-end using MongoDB, Express and Node Js. In addition, I have built a front-end user interface using React Js.

# Thinking process

I have brainstormed the idea and possible problems of this project through [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/doxRnjYV/inventory-management). I then proceeded to identify the core functions of our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and also to identify the possible future functions to be added to my application.
